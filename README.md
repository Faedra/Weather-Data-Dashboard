# Weather Dashboard | A data visualization website

A web dashboard/visualization presenting analysis of a weather dataset using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, as well as Bootstrap components, responsive design and media queries.

## This website is deployed to GitHub Pages @ https://faedra.github.io/Weather-Data-Dashboard/

### Project Description:

In building this dashboard, I displayed a set of weather plots for comparison and analysis, with the focus being presentation, ease of navigation, and accessibility across multiple devices. To do this, I needed to create individual, responsive pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. I built a landing page, a page displaying a comparison of all plots, a page displaying the source data, and a navigation menu with dropdowns where appropriate.

As mentioned above, this visualization relies on a responsive bootstrap grid, which transforms based on screen width. Specifically the project uses the bootstrap `navbar` component for the header, the bootstrap `table` component for the data page, and the bootstrap grid for responsiveness, along with a CSS media query for the navigation menu.
